Create new project that is winform .net framework
For the naming, we would like to be clean.
We can name it ApplicataionUserInterface but we can use another platform so what should we name it after this?
So we can name it line RMApplicationDesktopUI or RMApplication.DesktopUI

Then go to properties and change the assembly name to RetailManager
so what this does is to change the application name into this RetailManager.exe

Next we have problem but for now we want to set the winform as startup project
Then explain it why

Open nuget package and add caliburn.micro
This is to prepare us for Dependency Injection

Next will create the MVVM pattern/layer
	• Models
	• ViewModels
	• Views

We break it in 3 layers but this 3 still the UI project

Models means to hold all the data for the views display
And the viewmodels kind like a connection with model and view


We will use SOLID design patterns
S - single responsibility
O - open/close
L - liskov substitute
I - interface segmentation
D - dependency inversion

Create ShellView in Views folder and change the Program to ShellView

With this we will use autofac
So we will begin to wire up the autofac

Create a interface for ShellView
Create the ContrainerConfig

public static IContainer Configure()
        {
            var builder = new ContainerBuilder();
            builder.RegisterType<ShellView>().As<IShellView>();

            return builder.Build();
        }


Change the program to this
 var container = ContainerConfig.Configure();
            using (var scope = container.BeginLifetimeScope())
            {
                var app = scope.Resolve<IShellView>();
                Application.Run(app.Run());
            }

Then run
Now commit

Add WPF Project with MVVM

Adds our WinForm user interface project
and configure it with AutoFac for our
MVVM framework. Also includes the
Container DI system.

If you notice the publishlocations folder is red dot. Meaning our
.gitignore files is working

After reviewing the codes lets push
